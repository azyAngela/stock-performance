1. Model
Previous view classes are working, add a utility class named AutoInvest to help implement "Dollar-cost Strategy" and "add by weight". It works good.
Add a interface for using API, thus we can choose which API we want to use if we have another one.

2. View
Previous view classes are working, old text-based interface is still working, and all the functions in the new GUI works as well, including create new, view existing, upload file, view cost basis, add/delete from existing, and create new using dollar-cost averaging strategy.


3. Controller
The old controller works well. The controllerNew works as well when dealing with the updated model and GUI view in displaying the information in GUI.
